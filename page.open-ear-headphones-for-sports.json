Additionally, the noise reduction function is designed for the microphone, helping your voice to be heard more clearly during calls. If you hear background noise from the other person during a call, this is related to the noise reduction capability of their device."

OpenRun Pro 2 features the latest DualPitch™ technology and a dual-layer mesh design, which provides superior sound quality compared to OpenRun.\n\nExtensive customer research has shown that the IP55 water resistance is sufficient for daily sports and exercise activities, so you can use it with confidence. However, we do not recommend using the headphones in extreme environments such as hot springs or saunas, nor while swimming, showering, or running in heavy rain for extended periods."

High temperatures can accelerate headphone aging, and elements such as sulfur in sauna environments may degrade adhesives, affecting waterproof performance.\n\nOpenSwim Pro can be used in both seawater and swimming pools. To prevent corrosion from saltwater, it is recommended to rinse the headphones with fresh water after use.\n\nNote: During charging or data transfer, ensure the headphones and cables are dry to maintain proper device functionality and safety."

            "text": "No, Bluetooth mode cannot be used underwater.\n\nBluetooth signals propagate well in air because air is almost transparent to these radio frequencies, allowing the signals to travel with minimal obstruction. However, water is a conductive medium and strongly absorbs radio waves, especially high-frequency signals. When radio waves enter water, their energy rapidly decreases, and the transmission distance is greatly reduced. This causes the signal strength to drop below the level required for effective communication, making stable connection and data transfer impossible.\n\nTherefore, we recommend using the MP3 mode of the swimming series headphones for underwater use."
